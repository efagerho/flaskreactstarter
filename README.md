# Flask + React + Docker Starter

Starter repo for getting a React app up and running on a Flask server.
Additional scripts are provided for packaging the app into a docker container. 

## Installation

Install npm, nodejs and docker followed by:

```
npm i
npm run build
npm run docker
```

The last command only works if you're in the docker group (which isn't recommended).
